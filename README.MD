## Low Cost LIDAR Sensor System for Autonomous Vehicles


This research paper explores making process of a low-cost LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor for autonomous vehicles. LIDAR sensors are essential for enabling autonomous vehicles to analyze their surrounding and make real-time decisions. However, the high cost of commercial LIDAR systems is an important to the widespread adoption of self-driven vehicles. To address this challenge, we have developed a low-cost LIDAR sensor that is based on off-the-shelf components and open-source software. We describe the design and implementation of our sensor and evaluate its performance in a series of real-world tests. Results demonstrate that our low-cost LIDAR sensor is capable of providing reliable and accurate 3D mapping and object detection, while significantly reducing the cost of LIDAR systems for autonomous vehicles. The findings of this research hold great importance for the advancement of LIDAR, as they have far-reaching consequences that can shape future developments and applications in this area. affordable and accessible self-driven vehicle technology, which has the potential to transform transportation and improve road safety.
